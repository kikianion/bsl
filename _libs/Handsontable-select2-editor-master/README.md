Handsontable Select2 Editor

Here is a jsfiddle of this editor working with Select2 3.5.2 and Handsontable 0.16.0
http://jsfiddle.net/trebuchetty/tLp0dnga/ (hat-tip to @abugroup for helping to put this together)


Using this custom editor

```JAVASCRIPT
var optionsList = [{id: 1, text: 'jsmith'}, {id: 2, text: 'wjones'}, ...];
var columnsList = [{
                    data: "UserName", // from datasource
                    editor: 'select2',
                    select2Options: { // these options are the select2 initialization options 
                        data: optionsList,
                        dropdownAutoWidth: true,
                        allowClear: true,
                        width: 'resolve'
                    }
                },
                ...
                ];


this.$container = $("#container");
this.$container.handsontable({
    data: [...],
    columns: columnsList
    });
```

I've left out a lot here for brevity, so let me know if any clarification is required.
